# Exercise #20: Building PDFs

## Exercise details

There are two goals with this exercise.

1. Create a PDF invoice given some data about a fake customer's recent transactions
2. Generate a course completion certificate for Gophercises and add your name to it!

*Whoa, what?!?* Yep, you read that right. Many courses will give you a course completion certification. This one teaches you to generate it yourself! Sweet, right? ðŸ˜Ž

**NOTE:** *The design part of creating PDFs can take a while, so don't get upset if this exercise takes you a few hours to get all those details right.*
